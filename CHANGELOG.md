# CHANGELOG

## 2026-02-11
- Initial starter-pack structure created.
- Added combined Claude + Codex project/global packs.
- Added installer scripts for project and optional global setup.
- Added verification script.
- Added full reference docs and onboarding/architecture documentation.
- Added TDD and eval contracts to project templates (`packs/project/AGENTS.md`, `packs/project/CLAUDE.md`, `packs/project/.agent/TEST.md`).
- Added no-assumption eval policy and required end-user eval walkthrough format.
- Synced global templates with TDD/eval + low-friction inference guidance (`packs/global/codex/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `packs/global/claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
- Upgraded `scripts/install-project.sh` with repo-based command auto-detection plus explicit override support.
- Updated onboarding docs for one-command install in both new and existing repos.
